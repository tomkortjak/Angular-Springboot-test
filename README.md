Test running manual:

Front-end: 
For running the front-end test you will have to open the terminal in an
IDE and run the command "ng test". Your default browser will than open with 
jasmine running all of the tests.

Back-end:
For the backend you will have to go to EWA-PROJECT/server/test folder.
Here you will find multiple test files, run these files by right-clicking 
a file and then pressing: Run "FileName". Tests that contain MockMvc have 
to be run individually.
